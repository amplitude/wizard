/**
 * Agent-mode NDJSON event schema.
 *
 * The wizard's `--agent` mode emits one JSON line per significant moment to
 * stdout. Outer agents (Claude Code, Cursor, Codex, custom orchestrators)
 * parse these to drive their own UX — display login URLs, inspect plans,
 * decide whether to retry, surface choices to the human.
 *
 * This module is the source of truth for that wire format. Every event is a
 * member of `AgentEvent` and shares the `AgentEventEnvelope` shape:
 *
 *   { v, '@timestamp', type, message, session_id, run_id, data, level? }
 *
 * Schema rules:
 *   - `v` is the wire-format version. Bump on any breaking shape change.
 *   - Discriminator is `data.event` for `lifecycle` / `prompt` / `result` / `error` events.
 *   - Never include access tokens, API keys, refresh tokens, or full URLs
 *     containing query-string secrets in any payload.
 *   - Resume hints (`resumeFlags`, `resumeCommand`) are arrays of CLI argv,
 *     not shell strings, so outer agents can spawn directly.
 *
 * The `AgentUI` class (`src/ui/agent-ui.ts`) is the only writer of these
 * events. New events MUST land here first so the schema doc and the emitter
 * stay in sync.

 * `level`, `data`, `data_version`).

 * shifts the contract for that one event.
 *
 * Solution: every event whose `data` shape is part of the public API
 * carries a `data_version` integer on the envelope. Orchestrators
 * should branch on `(type, data?.event, data_version)` rather than
 * envelope `v` alone. The default for events without a registered
 * version is 1 — adding `data_version` to an event for the first time
 * is itself the v=1 baseline. Bump to 2 on the first breaking change.
 *
 * Why a flat number per event-type+discriminator instead of one global
 * counter: a global counter forces every orchestrator to upgrade in
 * lockstep when any event changes. Per-event versions let one event's
 * shape evolve without invalidating an orchestrator that only cares
 * about (e.g.) `tool_call` and `dashboard_created`.

// ── Recoverable error hints ─────────────────────────────────────────
//
// Every NDJSON `error` event carries a `recoverable` discriminator and
// an optional `suggestedAction` so consuming agents (Claude Code,
// Cursor, custom orchestrators) know what to do next without parsing
// the message string. Without these, every error looks the same — the
// outer agent has to write its own ad-hoc remediation map per error
// pattern. With them, "wizard failed; re-run with `--yes`" becomes a
// machine-readable instruction.

/**
 * What an outer agent should do in response to this error.
 *
 *   - `retry`              — transient failure (network blip, gateway 5xx).
 *                            Re-spawn the wizard with the same flags.
 *   - `reinvoke_with_flag` — the call needs different args (auto-pick
 *                            refused, missing required flag). Use
 *                            `suggestedAction.command` as the new argv.
 *   - `human_required`     — needs a human (auth expired, quota hit,
 *                            permission denied). Surface to user.
 *   - `fatal`              — internal wizard bug or unrecoverable state.
 *                            Don't retry; route to bug report flow.
