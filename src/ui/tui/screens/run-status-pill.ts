/**
 * run-status-pill — resolve the bottom-pill text for `RunScreen`.
 *
 * The original `resolveRunScreenStatus` returned the canonical step's
 * `activeForm` (e.g. "Wiring up event tracking") whenever a journey task
 * was in_progress. That fixed the state/narration mismatch reported in
 * #646 but it traded one problem for another: the pill became boring.
 * Users see the same canonical sentence in the Tasks list above and
 * (sometimes) in the journey stepper — repeating it in the bottom bar
 * is a wasted line.
 *
 * This module replaces the canonical step's `activeForm` with the most
 * SPECIFIC content the wizard already has at hand. The store carries
 * plenty of richer signal (file writes, tool activities, retry status,
 * compaction state, event-plan size) — we just have to surface it.
 *
 * Priority (highest wins). Each tier is short-circuit; if it returns a
 * non-empty string, lower tiers are not consulted.
 *
 *   1. Active **post-agent** step's `activeForm` — single source of
 *      truth during the FinalizingPanel phase (charts / dashboard /
 *      commit). Untouched from the original contract.
 *
 *   2. **Compaction / retry / cold-start activity** — `currentActivity`
 *      is set whenever the wizard is mid-stall (PreCompact hook, retry
 *      sleep, ingestion poll, etc.). When it's set the pill shows that
 *      message. This is the highest-priority "what's happening now"
 *      signal and beats the canonical task name.
 *
 *   3. **Awaiting user sign-off on the event plan.** When the wizard
 *      has pushed an `event-plan` pendingPrompt (the EventPlanScreen is
 *      modally awaiting Y/N), the pill says "N events approved · awaiting
 *      your sign-off" — concrete and actionable.
 *
 *   4. **Recent file write** (planned/applied) — within the last few
 *      seconds, render "Editing src/foo.ts" or "✓ Wrote src/bar.ts".
 *      Specific to the file the agent has its hands on RIGHT NOW. Falls
 *      through after a short window so a stale file path doesn't pin the
 *      pill while the agent is doing other things.
 *
 *   5. **Recent tool activity** — same idea, slightly less specific:
 *      "Reading package.json", "Running pnpm add @amplitude/…". The
 *      `toolActivities` buffer is already verb-formatted by
 *      `formatToolCallLabel`, so we just take the most recent entry.
 *      Same staleness window as tier 4.
 *
 *   6. **Active canonical task's `activeForm`** — the original behavior.
 *      Used when none of the live signals above are recent.
 *
 *   7. **Trailing free-form `pushStatus` line** — cold-start fallback,
 *      before any task has flipped to in_progress.
 *
 * The cap (`STATUS_MAX_LEN`) is enforced by the caller in `RunScreen`,
 * not here — this module only computes the message.
